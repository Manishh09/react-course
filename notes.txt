React: a javascript library, can customize the structure unlike the frameworks like Angular where in a mvc approach is followed under the guidelines

React - For website and mobile development

React DOM - websites

CDN Links:

    This is why we will have two CDN Links which we basically import in index.html file to be get the React and React DOM objects availability

    Must be imported before we use the functionalities of React and React DOM 

Two ways to create an element in React:

    using  React.createElement('<your_element>', {<attributes>}, "<content>")
                        <attributes> -> camelCase
    using  JSX

JSX:
 - html like structure in js
 - const ele = <div></div>
 - gets converted into react.createElement form and renders into dom

content inside a react element is referred as `children`

webpack: Its a bundler, used to make the browser understand the react app code 
- fetches node modules
- minifies converted
- css file reading
- compiling code
- memory management

ES6 version is not understood by the browser, ES5 will only be understood 
 - babel will be used here in this camelCase
 - babel will transpile the ES6 code to ES5
 - {
        "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
    }
    - "@babel/preset-env" : js code will get understood by the browser
    - "@babel/preset-react": react app code will get understood by the browser

HMR: Hot Module Reload - for example if you make any change in the js file / html / css the UI gets updated swiftly 

webpack will generate the bundle.js and injects it into index.html - you can see the developer tool while the app is running
