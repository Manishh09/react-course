React: a javascript library, can customize the structure unlike the frameworks like Angular where in a mvc approach is followed under the guidelines

React - For website and mobile development

React DOM - websites

CDN Links:

    This is why we will have two CDN Links which we basically import in index.html file to be get the React and React DOM objects availability

    Must be imported before we use the functionalities of React and React DOM 

Two ways to create an element in React:

    using  React.createElement('<your_element>', {<attributes>}, "<content>")
                        <attributes> -> camelCase
    using  JSX

JSX:
 - html like structure in js
 - const ele = <div></div>
 - gets converted into react.createElement form and renders into dom
